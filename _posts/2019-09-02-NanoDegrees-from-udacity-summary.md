In this post a summary of my Udacity Nano-degrees (ND) github repositories is listed. They contain the submitted and accepted project code.

I started my first ND in march of 2019, with the Deep Learning ND (DLND). It took me 4 months to complete 5 coding projects. Immediatelly after graduation from the DLND I started the next one, the Computer Vision ND (CVND).

Here are my uploaded projects:
