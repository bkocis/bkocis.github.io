In this post a summary of my Udacity Nano-degrees (ND) github repositories is listed. They contain the submitted and accepted project code.

I started my first ND in march of 2019, with the Deep Learning ND (DLND). It took me 4 months to complete 5 coding projects. Immediately after graduation from the DLND I started the next one, the Computer Vision ND (CVND).

Here are my uploaded projects:


Deep Learning ND:
-----------------

- [Bike sharing patterns](https://github.com/bkocis/DLND_Pr_1_bike_sharing_patterns)

- [Dog breed classifier ](https://github.com/bkocis/DLND_Pr_2_dog_breed_classifier)

- [Generating TV scripts](https://github.com/bkocis/DLND_Pr_4_Generate_TV_scripts)

- [Face Generation](https://github.com/bkocis/DLND_Pr_5_Face_Generation)

- [Model deployment in SageMaker AWS](https://github.com/bkocis/DLND_Pr_7_deploying_model_AWS_SageMaker)


Computer Vision ND:

- [Facial keypoint detection](https://github.com/bkocis/CVND_Pr_1_Facial_Keypoint_Detection)

- [Landmark detection and tracking SLAM](https://github.com/bkocis/CVND_Pr_3_Landmark_detection_and_tracking_SLAM)



Final toughts - my very personal Udacity experience
---------------------------------------------------

What I like the most about the projects are the phases of learning, and of completing the project.
The work on the project itself is very intense. The nanodegree notebooks are in general very well organized. Although, in the beginning the it looks complex, it is intimidating. But, then you go on, you complete the first functions, you manage to solve the architecture of the network - you learn the small details. And then little by little you are already at the middle of the project. The intense feeling, the rush of the approaching deadline loosens up a bit, and the real playing starts. You try do modify things, " what will happen if I do this.."; you do all the stupid little tests just to see what error messages you get. And then you are already at the end of the project. There is only the cleaning remaining - small refactoring, and spellcheck (#hashtag - please jupyter, for the love of god include spellcheck already).
