In this post a summary of my Udacity Nano-degrees (ND) github repositories is listed. They contain the submitted and accepted project code.

I started my first ND in march of 2019, with the Deep Learning NanoDegree (DLND). It took me 4 months to complete 5 coding projects. Immediately after graduation from the DLND I started the next one, the Computer Vision NanoDegree(CVND).

Here are my uploaded projects:


Deep Learning ND:

- [Collaboration and competition (Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning)] 

Final toughts - my very personal Udacity experience
---------------------------------------------------

What I like the most about the projects are the phases of learning, and of completing the project.
The work on the project itself is very intense. The nanodegree notebooks are in general very well organized. Although, in the beginning the it looks complex, it is intimidating. But, then you go on, you complete the first functions, you manage to solve the architecture of the network - you learn the small details. And then little by little you are already at the middle of the project. The intense feeling, the rush of the approaching deadline loosens up a bit, and the real playing starts. You try do modify things, " what will happen if I do this.."; you do all the stupid little tests just to see what error messages you get. And then you are already at the end of the project. There is only the cleaning remaining - small refactoring, and spellcheck (#hashtag - please jupyter, for the love of god include spellcheck already).


Phases of learning, as I see it
-------------------------------

phase 1

- analyse the given code - deconstruct it 
- search for existing solutions and study it. There is a lot to learn for other peoples code implementations.
- modify the found solutions (try to modify every single line)
- look up the used methods in the official documentation. That can clear out a lot of thing very fast - don't waste time to understand a particular method from the code body of an example project.

phase 2

- when you rewrote (made own changes) at least to 51% of the code (function, class) body, then you achieved something
- repeat this at least 2 times, just to be safe that you are not doing something correctly by accident

phase 3 

- search for examples outside the context of the provided example code. In the Udacity notebooks a lot of code is already given to you. Try to get other examples, datasets where this is not the case.

phase 4 

- apply the learned to your own problems, where there is no other data prepared, no other code written but the one that you constructed. You may use code snippets or classes from other examples. This is the ultimate goal, for you to solve problems by utilizing the knowledge you apparently obtained. 


Concluding remarks
------------------

Remember, by completing and graduating from a nanodegree course you will not become an expert in the field of your ND, not even by far. Consider this: are you able to write all the code for example that is in a final project from scratch? If the answer is not "No problem, I can do it in an afternoon...", then there is still a lot to work on that rookie status.

These nanodegrees gave me a lot of structure to understand the details and concepts for the application of deep learning. What is clear to me is that there is a lot that I need to learn to be able to practice DL methods as second nature in everyday work.
