I just love the Github:Gist. For me, it is like Twitter, but for code.

Github:Gist is an additional feature on github that allows sharing of code snippets, notes, to do lists and whatever. 

It is more for all the stuff, for which you would not care making a repo, writing a README. I like to drop a method, a functions, or parts of a tutorial that I am doing at the moment into a gist, and so I have it accessible, but without a lot of hustle to integrate code into a blog post or repo. 

I like [this](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) for the usage of a gist publication.
