A small summary of [Stackexchange](https://stackexchange.com/sites#) users that just make me go bananas. These user have accumulated several hundred thousand internet-points. 
It appears to me also that the quality and apparent intelligence of these users seam to be higher then the average developer/programmer, or even a nerd in general.


1. [Gilles](https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/885/gilles)

Gilles also shows a nice strategic question posting, which with he obtained a large number of internet points - just amazing to observe the ingenuity [Why is Kali Linux so hard to set up? Why won't people help me?](https://unix.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5360/why-is-kali-linux-so-hard-to-set-up-why-wont-people-help-me/5361#5361)


2. [Aaron Hall](http://aaronchall.github.io/)

Aaron sums it up very nicely: 

"Remember, it's all just internet points, which probably won't be worth anything ever. Maybe something when the singularity hits and AI takes over, but I don't see that happening any time soon, so you have plenty of time until then. (I would think that StackOverflow's internet points would be the most valuable, at that point.) "


In this post I gather from time to time remarkable users, just in order to remind myself where are the limits - consider this as my "stack-exchange" hall of fame.
