Summary of Command-line interface related repos

"A command-line interface (CLI) is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

When doing data wrangling, or transformation I often use some of the [GNU packages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_packages), a bunch of functions or programs that operate directly from the command line. Such tools are for example `grep` g/re/p (globally search a regular expression and print), `find`, `awk`, or `sed`.
